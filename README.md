## About me 🙋‍♂️

to overcome problems. I am willing to
participate in extracurricular activities and
projects. I am a member of a science club
“Social Robots” where we focus on
developing solutions to human-robot
interaction problems. Currently I am
working on my engineering project, which
is “Interactive human-robot game”.
